# My Portfolio 

Welcome — this repository showcases my hands-on projects, lab work, and technical skills. It highlights real, reproducible work in system administration, networking, automation, and ethical hacking performed in isolated lab environments (Hyper-V). The goal: demonstrate practical knowledge, problem-solving, and a strong foundation for entry-level sysadmin / security roles.

## Projects & Labs (Featured)
> Each project folder contains a `README.md`, `scripts/` and `screenshots/` (or `scans/` for security labs). Click the repo links to see the full steps, scripts, and images.

### 1) Linux Server Setup (Complete)
**Objective:** Build a Linux server with user management, SSH hardening, Apache web hosting, and basic firewall configuration.  
**Tools:** Hyper-V, Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS, Bash, Apache, OpenSSH, UFW  
**Deliverables:** `scripts/setup.sh`, screenshots (SSH login, Apache page, UFW status), step-by-step README.  
**Repo:** https://github.com/AustinKingPro/LinuxServerSetup  
**Quick preview:**  
- Automates initial hardening and Apache install  
- Creates user(s) and configures sudo access  
- Enables UFW rules for SSH & Apache  
- README includes commands, screenshot examples, and repo layout

### 2) Ethical Hacking Lab (Safe & Legal)
**Objective:** Perform reconnaissance, scanning, and controlled vulnerability verification against intentionally vulnerable targets in an isolated lab. Document findings and remediation.  
**Tools:** Kali Linux, Metasploitable / OWASP Juice Shop, Nmap, Nikto, Gobuster, Burp Suite, Metasploit (lab-only), Wireshark  
**Deliverables:** saved scans (`scans/`), screenshots (`screenshots/`), `notes/commands.md`, and a concise remediation report (`report/ethical-hacking-report.pdf`).  
**Repo:** https://github.com/AustinKingPro/EthicalHackingLab  
**Highlights:**  
- Isolated Hyper-V private switch lab topology  
- Example scans (nmap, nikto, gobuster) and packet captures  
- Responsible reporting template with remediation steps and severity ratings

### 3) Windows Server Lab (Active Directory + GPO)
**Objective:** Stand up a Windows domain, configure AD users/OUs, Group Policy, DHCP & DNS, and automate user creation with PowerShell.  
**Deliverables:** PowerShell scripts, AD screenshots, GPO examples, network diagram.  
**Repo:** https://github.com/AustinKingPro/WindowsServerLab

### 4) Networking Lab
**Objective:** Design and configure LAN/WAN topologies, VLANs, routing, and switching using Packet Tracer / EVE-NG.  
**Deliverables:** topology files, configuration snippets, screenshots, and packet traces.  
**Repo:** https://github.com/AustinKingPro/NetworkLab

---

### 5) Automation & Monitoring
**Objective:** Build automation scripts (PowerShell / Python) for user onboarding, monitoring, and log collection. Deploy simple monitoring (Zabbix/Nagios) to track VM health.  
**Deliverables:** automation scripts, sample log outputs, monitoring screenshots/dashboards.  
**Repo:** https://github.com/AustinKingPro/AutomationMonitoring
